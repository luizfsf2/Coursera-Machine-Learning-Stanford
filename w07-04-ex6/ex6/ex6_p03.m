%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
%
%     gaussianKernel.m
%     dataset3Params.m
%     processEmail.m
%     emailFeatures.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% =============== Part 3: Implementing Gaussian Kernel ===============
%  You will now implement the Gaussian kernel to use
%  with the SVM. You should complete the code in gaussianKernel.m
%
fprintf('\nEvaluating the Gaussian Kernel ...\n')

x1 = [1 2 1]; x2 = [0 4 -1]; sigma = 2;
sim = gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma);

fprintf(['Gaussian Kernel between x1 = [1; 2; 1], x2 = [0; 4; -1], sigma = %f :' ...
         '\n\t%f\n(for sigma = 2, this value should be about 0.324652)\n'], sigma, sim);
