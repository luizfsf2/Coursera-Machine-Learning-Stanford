%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
%
%     gaussianKernel.m
%     dataset3Params.m
%     processEmail.m
%     emailFeatures.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% =============== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data ================
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  The following code will load the dataset into your environment and plot
%  the data.
%

fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

% Load from ex6data1: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data1.mat');

% Plot training data
plotData(X, y);

#fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
#pause;

%% ==================== Part 2: Training Linear SVM ====================
%  The following code will train a linear SVM osn the dataset and plot the
%  decision boundary learned.
%

% Load from ex6data1: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data1.mat');

fprintf('\nTraining Linear SVM ...\n')

% You should try to change the C value below and see how the decision
% boundary varies (e.g., try C = 1000)

C = 1;
model = svmTrain(X, y, C, @linearKernel, 1e-3, 20);
visualizeBoundaryLinear(X, y, model);

title('C2');
C = 2;
model = svmTrain(X, y, C, @linearKernel, 1e-3, 20);

figure (4);
title('C10');
C = 10;
model = svmTrain(X, y, C, @linearKernel, 1e-3, 20);
visualizeBoundaryLinear(X, y, model);

figure (5);
title('C100');
C = 100;
model = svmTrain(X, y, C, @linearKernel, 1e-3, 20);
visualizeBoundaryLinear(X, y, model);
#fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
