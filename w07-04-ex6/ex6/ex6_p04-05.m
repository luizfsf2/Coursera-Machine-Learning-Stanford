%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
%
%     gaussianKernel.m
%     dataset3Params.m
%     processEmail.m
%     emailFeatures.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% =============== Part 4: Visualizing Dataset 2 ================
%  The following code will load the next dataset into your environment and 
%  plot the data. 
%

fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

% Load from ex6data2: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data2.mat');

% Plot training data
plotData(X, y);

%fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');

%% ========== Part 5: Training SVM with RBF Kernel (Dataset 2) ==========
%  After you have implemented the kernel, we can now use it to train the 
%  SVM classifier.
% 
fprintf('\nTraining SVM with RBF Kernel (this may take 1 to 2 minutes) ...\n');

% Load from ex6data2: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data2.mat');

% SVM Parameters
C = 1; sigma = 0.1;

% We set the tolerance and max_passes lower here so that the code will run
% faster. However, in practice, you will want to run the training to
% convergence.
model= svmTrain(X, y, C, @(x1, x2) gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma)); 
visualizeBoundary(X, y, model);

%fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
%pause;
